#### ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL ELECTIVE TAMIL LANGUAGE PROGRAMME (NETP)

**BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE**

1.  The programme aims to nurture secondary school and Junior College (JC) students who have an aptitude in the Tamil Language to acquire greater proficiency in the language and deeper appreciation of the language, literature and culture. The NETP programme will be hosted at the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC).

**NETP (Secondary)**

_Target Student Groups_

1.  At the secondary level, the NETP will be open to both Higher Tamil Language (HTL) students studying at UPTLC and students who offer HTL in their respective secondary schools and centres. Briefing sessions will be conducted for interested HTL students who will then register themselves for the NETP at UPTLC.

_Programme Structure_

1.  For NETP (Secondary), HTL students could enrol in elective modules at UPTLC. The range of modules serves different objectives of honing their language skills, cultivating their appreciation of Tamil literature and culture, or expanding their knowledge of the history of Tamils, current affairs of India and the usage of Tamil language in Technology. The modules will be conducted in some afternoons during term time and re-runs of these modules will also be conducted during the school holidays. For each module, the NETP students are expected to complete an oral presentation, a reflection journal and participate in online forum discussion through the SLS.  
    
2.  Students in the NETP programme will be given opportunities to attend cultural camps, flagship programmes (e.g. internship programme, job attachment or budding writer mentoring programme), workshops and talks by TL experts and participate in one overseas immersion of at least two weeks duration to India at Secondary 3.  
    
3.  Overall, the NETP (Secondary) programme will take 100 – 120 hours over four years from Sec 1 to Sec 4 (or about 30 hours per year).
